# Living Willow Elixir Bar - Project Overview

## About This Project

**The Living Willow Elixir Bar** is a Next.js application that provides personalized wellness drink recommendations through an AI-driven health assessment. The app matches users to non-alcohol health "booster" mocktails based on their current wellness needs and body system support requirements.

## Core Concept

- **Purpose**: Personalized wellness drink recommendation system
- **Approach**: AI-driven conversational health assessment instead of static questionnaires
- **Goal**: Match users with elixirs that support their current health needs through ingredient-based metabolic pathway support

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.6 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- **Animation**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **AI Integration**: Claude API (Haiku model) for health assessment
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Utilities**: Lodash, classnames, lucide-react icons

## Key Features

### AI-Driven Health Assessment
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language health assessment instead of forms
- **Dynamic Questioning**: AI asks 3-7 personalized follow-up questions
- **Multiple Response Types**: Multiple choice and free-text responses
- **Safety Limits**: 7-question limit, 5-minute timeout, content filtering

### Body Systems Approach
The app categorizes wellness needs into four core body systems:

1. **üß† Mental & Emotional** - stress, anxiety, focus, mood
2. **üåø Digestive & Gut Health** - bloating, discomfort, digestive issues  
3. **‚ù§Ô∏è Physical Energy & Circulation** - fatigue, stamina, circulation
4. **üíß Recovery & Detox** - dehydration, cleansing, cellular repair

### Sophisticated Effects System
**Core Regulatory Effects** (bipolar -1 to 1 scale):
- Energy & Alertness (stimulating ‚Üî sedating)
- Stress Response (calming ‚Üî anxiety-inducing)
- Inflammation (anti-inflammatory ‚Üî pro-inflammatory)
- Digestive Activity (stimulating ‚Üî suppressing)
- Circulation (vasodilating ‚Üî vasoconstricting)

**Core Support Effects** (0 to 1 scale):
- Immunity Support
- Hydration & Electrolytes
- Detoxification Support

**Derived Effects** (calculated from core effects):
- Mood = Stress √ó 0.6 + Energy √ó 0.4
- Vitality = Energy √ó 0.4 + Circulation √ó 0.3 + Detox √ó 0.3
- Stamina = Energy √ó 0.5 + Circulation √ó 0.3 + Hydration √ó 0.2

### Drink Menu (8 Elixirs)

1. **ü´ò Spirit Cacao + Ashwagandha** - Mood elevation and stress reduction
2. **üçã Mountain Leaf Elixir + Tulsi** - Clean energy and mental clarity
3. **ü•≠ Baobab Vital Brew + Moringa** - Hydration and immune support
4. **üçí Steppe Root Brew + Purple Willow** - Stamina and detox
5. **üéã Forest Pandan Fizz + Kava** - Digestive calm and mood uplift
6. **üçà Jade Mist Infusion + Gynostemma** - Vitality and circulation
7. **üå≥ Aspen Grove Tonic + Chaga** - Anti-inflammatory and recovery
8. **üçÉ Desert Bloom Tisane + Lemon Balm** - Digestive and nervous system calm

### Advanced Matching Algorithm
- **Effects-based matching**: Compares user health matrix to drink effect profiles
- **Weighted scoring**: Boost ingredients have 1.5x impact on effects
- **Confidence weighting**: Recommendations weighted by AI assessment confidence
- **Need-provision matching**: Bonus points for matching needs, slight penalty for unnecessary effects

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Core data structures and type definitions
- Ingredient database with comprehensive effects matrices
- Drink calculation system with effects inheritance
- Basic survey UI with body system selection
- Claude AI integration for conversational assessment
- Motion animation system for smooth UI transitions

### üöß In Progress
- Survey flow completion and state management
- AI response parsing and health matrix extraction
- Drink recommendation algorithm integration

### üìã Planned Features
- Menu browsing and drink detail views
- Order placement and management system
- Server dashboard for order tracking
- Admin analytics dashboard
- QR code integration for table service

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
```

## Key Business Logic

### Health Assessment Flow
1. User selects body systems needing support
2. AI conducts personalized 3-7 question conversation
3. Responses mapped to quantified health matrix (8 core effects)
4. Best-matching drink calculated via effects similarity
5. Recommendation presented with explanation

### Ingredient Science
Each ingredient has:
- **Flavor profile**: 10-dimension taste characteristics
- **Effects matrix**: 8-dimension health impact values
- **Metabolic pathway mapping**: How ingredients affect body systems

### Quality Assurance
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Effect validation**: Core vs support effect categorization
- **Confidence tracking**: AI assessment reliability scoring
- **Session management**: Timeout and question limits

## Architecture Highlights

### Functional Design
- Pure functions for calculations
- Immutable state management
- Separation of concerns between UI and business logic

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient motion value updates with change detection
- Lazy loading and code splitting ready

### Extensibility
- Modular ingredient and effect system
- Easy addition of new drinks or effects
- Configurable survey parameters and AI prompts

## Usage Notes for Claude Code

- **Development server**: `npm run dev` (uses Turbopack)
- **Main entry point**: `src/app/page.tsx` ‚Üí `SurveyView`
- **State management**: React hooks with custom `useSurvey` hook
- **AI Integration**: Uses Claude Haiku model via `/api/survey` endpoint
- **Data flow**: User input ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí health matrix ‚Üí drink matching ‚Üí recommendation

The codebase follows Next.js App Router conventions with TypeScript strict mode enabled. All components use modern React patterns with hooks and functional components.
